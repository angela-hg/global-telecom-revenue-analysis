# 📊 Global Telecom Revenue Analysis & Insights (2020)

This project is a Power BI report I created to analyze global telecom revenue and better understand how different regions, customers, and account managers contribute to overall business performance. Built from an Excel dataset, it’s a complete end-to-end BI solution I built from scratch, focusing on clarity, storytelling, and practical insights that someone in a business role could use right away.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Telecommunications companies operate across diverse regions and customer segments. Understanding where revenue is generated, who the top-performing account managers are, and how trends evolve over time is essential for strategic planning.

This dashboard provides:

- A full regional revenue breakdown  
- Monthly revenue and net revenue trends  
- Top customers by net revenue  
- Account manager performance  
- Revenue vs. volume comparisons for key regions  
- Dynamic filtering by region, manager, customer, and network  

All visualizations are interactive and automatically update based on user selections.

## 🧠 What I Focused On

When building the report, I put special attention into:

- Creating a clean layout that’s easy to follow  
- Using colors subtly so visuals stand out without overwhelming the viewer  
- Designing slicers that allow filtering by region, account manager, customer, and network  
- Making each visual meaningful instead of decorative  
- Keeping the user experience simple and smooth
